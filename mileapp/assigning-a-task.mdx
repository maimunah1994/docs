A Task can have either one of the three status:
1. Unassigned ➝ When the task has not been assigned to anyone
2. Ongoing ➝ When the task has been assigned to someone but not done yet
3. Done ➝ When the task has been done

<blockquote style="color: blue;">
    A task can be assigned to multiple people; if a task is assigned to multiple people, they can all see it and its details, but only one person can actually do it and mark it as done.
</blockquote>

## Assigning each task individually

If you want to assign each task individually, select one or more assignees from the assignee column in the task.
