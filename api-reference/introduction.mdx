## Welcome

The Mile API are using RESTful API standard, which is widely recognized in the industry for its simplicity and effectiveness in designing networked applications. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts JSON request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs. The Mile API differs for every account as we release new versions and tailor functionality.


## Authentication

In our system, each user is limited to possessing only one personal access token without an expiration time. If a new token is generated, the old personal access token will become inactive.
All requests need an Bearer Token for authentication. Generate your API Key here:

1. Visit https://web.mile.app.
2. Enter your user email address and password.
3. Sign in to your account.
4. Navigate to Profile -> Personal Token.
5. Click New to create a new token.
6. Fill in the token name (this is typically used to describe the token's purpose) and choose the expiration date in the Void input.
7. Click Generate.

<b>Important</b>: You can only view and copy the token once it is generated, so make sure to save it in a secure location.
